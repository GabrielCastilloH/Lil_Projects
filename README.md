# Lil_Projects
Here I will post challenge projects that I made with python.

I will make simple little projects just for fun and to exercise my brain, I'll post them here.

While they might not be that useful, I like making them, and whenever I can I will try to make them less subjective and more objective.
What I mean when I say that is to make it have more uses rather than just solve the problem that I am specifically trying to solve.

Let's see where this goes.
